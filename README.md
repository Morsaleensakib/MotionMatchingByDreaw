# MotionMatchingByDreaw
Animation system for Unity engine based on motion matching

## New Assets (by class names):
### Editor assets:
**Data Creator** or **DataCreator_New** - stores data and animations to calculate "Motion Matching Data" asset <br/> 
**Data Creator Trajectory Settings** - stores past and future times of trajectory points needed to create trajectory<br/> 
**Motion Matching Bone Profile** - stores information about bones witch will be used to match animations<br/> 
**Motion Matching Data** - stores calculated data (trajectory and pose) for specific animations, this assets are created by editors which use **Data Creator** or **DataCreator_New**. This asset can be edited in **Motion matching data editor**

### Runtime assets:
**Motion Matching Animator_SO** - asset which represent animation state machine controller (like mecanim animation controller)<br/>
**Native Motion Group** - asset which represent one or more animations. This asset need to be placed in states of **Motion Matching Animator_SO**. <br/>
**Section Dependencies** - stores information about sections (time intervals) of animation

### Components:
**Motion Matching Component** - component equivalent to unity Animator component.

**Trajectory Maker** - component responsible for creating trajectory which is passed to **Motion Matching Component**. This is my own implementation and of course it can be replaced.

## Editors:

### Motion matching state machine graph editor

Editor for creating animation state machine.


### Motion matching data editor:

In this editor we can add a lot of data to **Motion Matching Data** asset, such as:
- Sections - time intervals in animation, wchich can be used as:
  - time intervals during which the transition conditions should be checked
  - time intervals where motion matching finding should find next animation
- Conatct points - points which are used in contact state of **Motion Matching Animator_SO** to move character betweem points specified in game world (they can be used to implement parkour)
- Curves - works like curves in normal animation, but theirs values are evaluated in LateUpdate.
- Animation Events - worls like events in normal animations but are fired in LateUpdate
- Animation Speed Curve - it is curve which represent animation speed multiplier
